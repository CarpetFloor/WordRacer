            <p>Compete with other player(s) to see who is the fastest word searcher!</p>
            
            <p>Start below, by either creating a new game by chosing from a couple different game modes, or join an already existing game</p>
            
            <p>Gain points from each word you find, and the quicker you find each word, the more points you get. The catch though, is that once a player finds a word, that word is crossed off and no other player can find that word. Additionally, you gain more points the shorter the word is.</p>
